PACMAN AI

The project involves implementing various search algorithms in Python to solve navigation problems for Pacman in different maze environments. It includes tasks such as implementing depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), uniform-cost search (UCS), A* search, and creating heuristics for more efficient pathfinding. The challenges range from finding paths to specific points to more complex tasks like reaching all corners or consuming all the dots in the maze. The search algorithms and heuristics are tested and evaluated in different maze scenarios to ensure efficient navigation for Pacman.

For specific details and instructions on how to complete each task, the code can be found in the "search.py" and "searchAgents.py" files provided in the GitHub repository.
